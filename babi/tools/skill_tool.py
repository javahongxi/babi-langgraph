"""Tool for discovering and activating Skills.

Skills are Markdown-based instruction sets loaded from:

- ~/.babi/skills/   — Babi-specific skills (higher priority)
- .qoder/skills/    — project-level skills (highest priority, relative to workspace root)

The agent calls list_skills to see what's available, then
use_skill to load the full instructions for a specific skill.
